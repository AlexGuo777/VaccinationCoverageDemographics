If possible, we also plan to dig deeper into the impact of COVID-19 on the flu vaccination coverage. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs. In the United States, millions of people contract the flu every year, and a significant number of people die from this disease despite free access to the vaccine. In our research project, we have two aims in regards to flu data. We would first like to establish a background on vaccination coverage rates across the United States, particularly how certain states or regions vary. In combining this with census data, we hope to gain insight into how socioeconomic and demographic factors contribute to these flu statistics. Factors of interest include education, household income, poverty level, and age/gender pyramids. We will utilize a variety of geographic map plotting as well as mosaic and Cleveland dot plots. The second aim of our research project is to assess the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on vaccination coverage of the flu, considering the social and political tension surrounding the mandatory vaccination. Perhaps the pandemic also affected mortality rates, either due to vaccine hesitancy or confusing flu for COVID-19 or vice versa. We plan to use a variety of time series visualizations to compare pre-2020 (pandemic start year) levels to post-2020. Overall, we aim to get a better understanding about the flu vaccination coverage in the United States. By using a variety of data sources and visualization techniques, we hope to tackle multiple perspectives on the status of the flu in this country. 2.2 Data availability Since our project topic mainly focuses on influenza vaccination, among all the data sources, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is one of the most authoritative organizations to gather data. The first dataset we plan to use is the influenza vaccination coverage rates for individuals that are six months or older, provided by the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). Here is some information about this dataset: Dataset source URL: CDC Dataset name: Influenza Vaccination Coverage for All Ages (6+ Months) Provider and Owner: National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) Last Updated: October 18, 2022 The data is collected from the National Immunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu), a national wide survey on vaccination coverage conducted by phone, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which is another telephone survey. The dataset is recently updated, but the frequency of updates is not clear based on the website. The dataset contains 186K records and is organized into 11 columns, including vaccination type, locations of records, time of records, estimates of vaccine coverage, confidence interval of estimates, etc. According to the website and my own observation, there may be issues regarding the reliability of coverage estimates because sample sizes are sometimes small. The dataset is available in CSV format. Therefore, to import it into R, we just need to download it from the website and read the CSV file. In case there is a need to contact the provider, we can do it directly on the CDC website by sending the provider a message. The second set of datasets we are going to introduce is the national population and demographics data, including population, gender, education levels, income, etc., by state, which will help discover relationships between influenza vaccination and demographics. Some information about this dataset is as follows: Dataset source URLs: 1.Census.gov (Population, Age, Gender) 2.Census.gov (Education Attainment) 3.Census.gov (Income) Provider and Owner: United States Census Bureau Update Frequency: 1 year The data is collected by American Community Survey, which is updated annually so that we can observe patterns in any given year or patterns growing across years. The newest update to the datasets the 2021 data. Some potential issues with the datasets are that some margins of error are somehow wide when doing estimations, and that some cells of the dataset are missing, which could cause problems when we do data cleaning. These datasets are all available to download in CSV format so that we can directly import them into R, allowing us to combine these demographic information easily and do plotting quickly. If there is a question, we can contact the owner by Census.gov. The third dataset we plan to introduce is the Covid-19 cases dataset. The intention is to see the impact of Covid on flu vaccination coverages, starting from 2020. Therefore, CDC is again the best choice when looking for Covid-related datasets. The dataset we chose focuses on the number of cases and deaths caused by Covid by state/region in a time series format. Here is some information about the dataset: Dataset source URL: CDC Dataset name: United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time Provider and Owner: CDC COVID-19 Response Last Updated: October 20, 2022 This data is collected from local reports. Although this dataset is recently updated, it is archived since CDC decided to stop tracking cases and deaths daily. But this dataset is enough for our end, since we are observing past trends. The dataset contains 60.1K rows and 15 columns, each row represents the total number of confirmed cases, deaths, probable cases, and other information in a state/region at a given time. According to CDC, it is not possible to gather the exact number of cases or deaths. Therefore, the numbers in this dataset is more or less an estimation. The dataset is available in CSV format. We can directly import it into R and combine it with other datasets since the state/region information is clearly marked in this dataset. In case we have a question, we can send the owner a message on CDC’s website. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Data Cleaning and Transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.1.1 Flu Vaccine Coverage Dataset Longyuan Gao is responsible for collecting the data. The influenza vaccine coverage data is collected from CDC, which is stated in the previous chapter. The dataset is comprehensive in the sense that it records the coverage rate for every state and region in the United States. Although there is some missing data (like the June coverage data), the overall quality is adequate enough for us to conduct visualizations. The data is collected from the National Immunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu), a national wide survey on vaccination coverage conducted by phone, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which is another telephone survey. To obtain a CSV file, I just downloaded it from the webpage. Here is some basic information about this dataset: Variables: vaccine type, geography(state/county/region, corresponding name, and a FIPS number), season(year), month, dimension(type(age/ethnicity), metric(&gt;6 year, e.g.)), estimated coverage, sample size, and CI. Number of records: about 185K. Problems: There are certain time periods where data is completely missing (like June 2021), and all the cells are in chr form, not numeric form. So that will bring some difficulties in the data transformation step. 3.1.2 Demographic Datasets For demographics data, I used all three nationwide census datasets (population, education attainment, and income) listed in the previous chapter. The census are all from 2021 since The latest data in the flu shot dataset is in 2021 (so that we can compare flu vaccine coverage rate with other demographics information in the same time scale). It is collected by the yearly American Community Survey conducted by Census Bureau. The data is available for download right on the webpage. Here is some basic information about these datasets: Variables and number of records: Education attainment: age groups by education attainment (for example, high school degree for people &gt;25), race groups by education, poverty rate, median earnings, etc. This dataset is not tidy, so we are to decide which metrics are variables, about 1 observation for each state. Population: similar situation to education, this dataset is not tidy. Variables are age groups (&lt;5, 5-9, etc.), selected age categories, statistical summaries, etc., and about 1 observation for each state. Income: total population in that state, income ranges, median, mean, etc., about 1 observation for each state. Problems: All of these three datasets are in chr form, so we have to spend time transforming these characters to numeric. Also, these datasets are in a nested column form, meaning that there are columns within a column if we view them in Excel. So, we have to find a way to deal with this kind of format. Moreover, there are so many variables that we do not need, so we also need to deal with the superfluous columns. 3.1.3 COVID-19 Case Dataset For COVID-19 case data, I again downloaded it from the CDC, as documented above. The dataset starts in 2020 and ends in 2022, which overlaps the flu shots data in the years 2020 and 2021, giving us the opportunity to visualize some trends in COVID cases and flu shots in the same time scale. The data is collected by local reports. The dataset is available for downloading online. Variables: submission date, state, total number of cases, Total probable cases, total confirmed cases, number of new cases, number of new probable cases, total number of deaths, total number of confirmed deaths Number of Records: about 60.1k. Problems: There are many variables we don’t need in this project. So, we have to select related columns before we do the analysis. And many rows have 0 and NAs. We should take this into consideration during analysis. 3.2 Data Cleaning and Transformation 3.2.1 Flu Vaccine Coverage Dataset First, we extract the year of the record from the season column, since the number after year in that column is not the month; then we combine the year with month in Month column, convert it to Date class and store it in a new column called “ym”. Also, we convert column Estimate, which is the estimated coverage rate, from chr to numeric. 3.2.2 Demographic Datasets For these datasets, we transform them more or less in the same way: first, only keep columns (which contain data for each state) with estimated value for each state, and transpose the dataset so that each row contains the metrics for only one state. Then, change the row names to the exact name of that state, and convert the entries to numeric. For education, we add a column called “high_school_higher_pop” that represents the total population that counts the number of people that attained at least a high school or equivalent diploma. For population, we add 3 columns, “children_pop”, which counts the number of people &lt;=14, “children_ratio”, ratio of children with respect to the total population, “elder_ratio”, ratio of people &gt;= 65 with respect to total population. For income, we only keep the income data for households, which is the majority, and we calculate the ratio of households who earn less than 14999 USD/year (stored in household_poverty_rate) or more than 150,000 USD/year (stored in household_wealth_rate) . 3.2.3 demo_df, an Enhanced Dataframe After doing above transformations, we combine the added and some inherent columns for the demographics dataset with the flu shot coverage data and form a more concise dataframe called demo_df, and we do further feature engineering in this df. To be more specific, this new df includes the by-state information on number of people who attained at least a high school or equivalent degree; population over 18; ratio of population over 18 that received at least a high school or equivalent degree (engineered by dividing 1 by 2); total population; population under 14; ratio of children (&lt;=14); population over 65; ratio of people &gt;=65; median household income; mean household income; household poverty rate; household wealth rate. The reason for doing this is that the original datasets are too cubersome for us to work with. 3.2.4 us_by_year, an Enhanced Dataframe This df is extracted from the flu shot dataset. In this dataframe, we only keep the records for national wide flu coverage for each month, from 2009 to 2021, and only records that is related to seasonal influenza, since H1N1 vaccines are only provided in earlier years. Also, we only care about the age metric, which should be “&gt;6” months, which will include all eligible people. Again, the reason we extract this specific dataframe is to eliminate unnecessary entries for easier plotting, while keeping the original dataframe the same in case we need to gather other data from it. 3.3 Missing value analysis Here we use naniar package to visualize. 3.3.1 Flu Vaccination Data From the plot, we can see that some rows are missing sample size variables, but since that variable is not taken into consideration, we are not concerned with that variable being NA; Also, some rows are missing Estimate, which is our focus. For rows with missing Estimates, we decided not to impute them, since we cannot be sure what variables it is dependent on. Some rows are also missing estimates and sample sizes together (maybe because that record is completely missing). Other than the missing columns shown in the graph, we are also observing that some rows are missing, such as all the June data mentioned before, which is completely missing without a note. This may be caused by the reset of vaccine contents in June of each year. Also, some earlier data contains vaccine coverage data for Asians and Native Americans, but that kind of information is missing in more current data. So we are very careful when dealing with the dataset: we regularly check if there is missing data in generated dataframe or abnormalities in the plot. 3.3.2 Demographic datasets 3.3.2.1 Population dataset Since visualizations for the whole dataset is unhelpful and somewhat meaningless (since there are just so many columns, and some columns are intended to be na), we only visualize the missing values on the subsets of the datasets which are used in our data analysis. There are no missing values in our used subsets of population dataset. 3.3.2.2 Education attaiment dataset There are no missing values in our used subsets of education dataset. 3.3.2.3 Household income dataset There are no missing values in our used subsets of household income dataset. Note here that the data for nationwide data is missing, but that doesn’t matter to our analysis, since we will truncate all nationwide data. 3.3.3 COVID-19 cases dataset We can observe that the most missing pattern is (conf_cases(confirmed cases), prob_cases (total probable cases), conf_death (confirmed deaths), prob_death), this can be caused by missing all reports for a certain day. The second most frequent missing pattern is (conf_death and prob_death), which both focus on the death count; the third most missing pattern is (conf_cases and prob_cases), which is a similar situation as the second pattern; there are also about 3400 rows that missing all confirmed and probable case and death counts. Other than these observable patterns, there are a few rows that have their own specific missing patterns, which may be caused by record glitches. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Geographical Patterns 4.2 Flu Vaccination Coverage Time Series Patterns 4.3 Demographical Patterns 4.4 Time Series Comparison of Nationwide New COVID Cases with Flu Vaccination Coverage", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Geographical Patterns Firstly, we created a choropleth map using color to indicate the value of flu vaccine coverage rate within United States by state for 2021 and check if there exist some geographical patterns for the distribution of flu vaccine coverage rate. We noticed that the areas with high vaccine coverage are mainly in the Midwest, North and East of the United States. And according to CDC report, In the United States, flu season usually occurs in the fall and winter. While influenza viruses spread year-round, most of the time flu activity peaks are between December and February. So low temperatures should be accompanied by high rates of flu infection and vaccine coverage rate. Go back to the US map above, Midwest regions, such as Colorado, are located near the Rocky Mountains, with high altitude and low temperature. The north has a high latitude and a lower temperature than the south. Due to factors such as ocean current and monsoon, the climate in the east is quite different from that in the west coast, and the temperature is relatively lower. Therefore, these regions have relatively higher coverage of flu vaccine. Thus, it appears that the distribution of flu vaccine coverage does have a geographical pattern. 4.2 Flu Vaccination Coverage Time Series Patterns Next, we do a time series analysis on nationwide flu vaccination coverage from 2009 to 2022 using the clean us_by_year data mentioned in the data section. Notice that the flu vaccination coverage dataset gives the cumulative flu shot coverage from last July or August. For example, the coverage rate in 2021-03 is the overall coverage rate from 2020-07 to 2021-03. Also notice that the content of seasonal influenza changes every year, so every year there is a sudden drop in coverage rate (probably in June). The red line in plot A below shows the highest coverage rate of that year. Based on the above two plots, one can observe that the overall trend of nationwide flu vaccination coverage rate is increasing (red line, which represents the overall coverage rate of that year), from about 42% in 2009 to about 52% in 2021. Notice there is a conspicuous drop in 2017, which corresponds to a report by the University of Minnesota. And after 2017, we notice a more or less remarkable increase in flu vaccination rate. We will zoom into the 2018-2022 range in later sections to find its correlations with the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking of the patterns for each year, from July or August the coverage rate quickly increases (concave up), and then slowly increases (concave down) from about December to April of the next year, which corresponds to our commonsense: those who want to take flu shots will do it as soon as the new flu shot releases, and fewer people will take flu shots before a new type of flu shot will come out in May or June. 4.3 Demographical Patterns Next we will relate flu vaccination coverage rates to demographical data. 4.3.1 Races and Age Groups: 2021 We will look at the 2021 data (the latest flu data we have). We plot flu vaccination coverage rates with respect to race groups and age groups. For race groups, we see that for the year 2021, the white race group has the most flu vaccination coverage rate, reaching about 53%, with other races (unfortunately we cannot be more specific about which races it contains due to the limitation of the dataset) being the second most covered group, also reaching more than 50%; the Hispanic race group is the second least covered group, with coverage rate about 44%; the Black race group is the least covered group, with coverage rate a little less than the Hispanic race group. This kind of pattern of flu coverage with respect to race groups may be intertwined with other socio-economical phenomena. Talking about age groups, if we use &gt;= 6 months as a baseline group, we can see that the older the age group is, the less coverage rate that group gets. age groups with 13-17 years old and 18-64 years old are below the baseline coverage rates, and the coverage rates for 6 months- 4 years old and 5-12 years old groups are well above the baseline group coverage rate. We notice that children gets more flu vaccine coverage (reaching about 64%) than teenagers and adults, and that is probably due to the fact that children are more susceptible to seasonal influenza, as stated in this article, so they need flu vaccines to prevent complications. 4.3.2 Races and Age Groups: A Time Series Analysis We do a time series analysis from 2009 to 2021 in race and age groups to see if there is some abnomalities similar to what we see in Simpson’s Paradox. We see that these race groups follow the same trend as the overall population, as we see in previous sections. We can observe that there are drops in flu vaccination coverage rates in the year 2017 in all four race groups. Notice that for the White, Non-Hispanic group, the rebound (increase) after 2017 is stronger than other race groups (the rebound is about 13%, from ~42% in 2017 to ~55% in 2020). For Other or Multiple Races, the rebound is not as strong as the white race group; for Hispanic and Black race group, the rebound is even weaker; for the Hispanic race group, we can hardly see a pronounced increase in coverage rate post-2017 as compared to pre-2017. The age groups time series pattern also follows the general pattern discussed before; moreover, it follows the 2021 age group pattern: generally speaking, the older ages the group contains, the less the flu rate coverage rate across years. A pronounced point in these plots is that for 13-17 years group, the coverage rate is equal to or even lower than the 18-64 years group in 2010, but it increases in the following years and exceeds the coverage rate for 18-64 years group. 4.3.3 Other Demographics Data: Sorting Out Important Factors Using Biplots Next, we draw a biplot based on selected features from demo_df, demographical information in 2021 introduced in the data section, to examine correlations between demographical features and flu vaccination coverage. Angles between vectors in biplots tell us about correlations. From this biplot, we can observe that flu shot coverage in 2021 is mostly correlated to the high school education attainment rate in states. Since the household poverty rate forms a large angle with flu shot coverage rate, it is (relatively strongly) negatively correlated with flu shot coverage in 2021. Notice that child_ratio is also similarly negatively correlated with flu shot coverage, but we decided to experiment more on household poverty rate in the next section because there are more states that lie near the household poverty rate axis. We can also observe state clusters in this graph: states like New Mexico, Alabama, and Kentucky lies at the negative flu shot coverage axis and positive household poverty rate axis, indicating that these states associated with high household poverty rate have less flu vaccination coverage; while for states like Colorado, New Jersey, and Hawaii lies at the positive axis of coverage and negative axis of household poverty rate, meaning these states have low poverty rate and high flu vaccinations coverage in 2021. In conclusion, we sort out two most important factors that are correlated, one positively (high school education attainment rate) and one negatively (household poverty rate), to flu vaccination coverage in 2021. Next, we will plot these two factors alongside flu vaccination coverage in 2021 to better illustrate the pattern. 4.3.4 Cleveland Dotplot of Most Important Factors Again we use demo_df to plot the two factors mentioned above, with data normalized for better visualization. As flu vaccination coverage rate increases, we see a decreasing pattern in the household poverty rate, or the blue dots; we can also see an increasing pattern in high school education attainment rate, or the orange dots. This confirms our conclusion made in the previous section. We will do our d3 interactive component based on this key finding. 4.4 Time Series Comparison of Nationwide New COVID Cases with Flu Vaccination Coverage "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component 5.1 VizHub 5.2 Summary and Takeaways", " Chapter 5 Interactive component 5.1 VizHub Click Here To See Visualization 5.2 Summary and Takeaways We chose to use D3 to create an interactive scatter plot, observing the relationship between the flu shot coverage rate in 2021 and proportion of high school educated individuals. As mentioned in the previous section, these two variables showed a particularly strong correlation with one another. By visualizing these on a scatterplot, we can see how all 50 states plus D.C. compare to one another, and coloring by region emphasizes geographic trends. There are two interactive components to this graph. Upon hovering over a given point, that point’s region will be highlighted across the graph, so the viewer can see how states within the same region match up across these variables. The second interactive component allows for deeper data analysis; upon clicking a given point, the name of that point’s state will print next to the point. This allows the viewer to identify outliers or specific points of interest with ease. The highlighting feature of this graphic gives us the strongest visualization to emphasize the geographic clustering of variables. The scatterplot points indicate a general upward, positive trend. The South region occupies many of the points with lower high school education rates and lower flu shot coverage rates, whereas the Northeast region occupies many of the higher education and coverage rate points. Although we identified similar trends when exploring our static plots in the previous section, this D3 graphic was critical in solidifying our arguments and conclusions.
