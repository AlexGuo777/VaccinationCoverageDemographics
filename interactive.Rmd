## Summary and Takeaways

We chose to use D3 to create an interactive scatter plot, observing the relationship
between the flu shot coverage rate in 2021 and proportion of high school educated 
individuals. As mentioned in the previous section, these two variables showed a 
particularly strong correlation with one another. By visualizing these on a
scatterplot, we can see how all 50 states plus D.C. compare to one another, and 
coloring by region emphasizes geographic trends.

There are two interactive components to this graph. Upon hovering over a given 
point, that point's region will be highlighted across the graph, so the viewer
can see how states within the same region match up across these variables.

The second interactive component allows for deeper data analysis; upon clicking a 
given point, the name of that point's state will print next to the point. This 
allows the viewer to identify outliers or specific points of interest with ease.

The highlighting feature of this graphic gives us the strongest visualization to
emphasize the geographic clustering of variables. The scatterplot points indicate
a general upward, positive trend. The South region occupies many of the points with 
lower high school education rates and lower flu shot coverage rates, whereas the 
Northeast region occupies many of the higher education and coverage rate points. 
Although we identified similar trends when exploring our static plots in the 
previous section, this D3 graphic was critical in solidifying our arguments and 
conclusions.
